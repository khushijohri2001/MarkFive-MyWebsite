                Schools are the most important part of a child's life. A child spends most of his time at school with a large number of strangers who eventually become his friends and instructors. When you are surrounded by so many individuals, you tend to learn faster and more. It is critical to teach kids vital skills that are required to exist in this very competitive and harsh society. Schools, without a question, are the finest places to learn for examinations, but they do not incorporate several important life skills in their academic curriculum. So, here are three skills that are not taught in schools.
            </p>
            <h2><b>1.	Financial Responsibility</b></h2>
            <p>
                Students in school are never taught how to make a living. A person's ultimate objective is to make money and meet his or her everyday needs. I feel that the school should educate their pupils on how to get work, manage clients, and handle money. A student should understand how to manage, save, and invest money. Money is a highly strong instrument that must be used properly. With a large sum of money at their disposal, students may engage in unethical behavior.

            </p>
            <h2><b>2.	Sociology and building relationships</b></h2>
            <p>
                Teenagers are not taught how to make friends or form solid connections at school. There are several sorts of pupils in our world; some are noisy, while others like to be quiet. The younger generation, commonly known as the silent generation, experiences hormonal shifts in their bodies. A very outgoing youngster as a child might transform into an introvert as a teenager. To avoid humiliation, they continue to conceal their feelings. They lack the confidence to approach new individuals. To counter this, teenagers must be taught the importance of expressing themselves and making friends. The value of friendship and connection is a crucial skill that every modern student should have.
            </p>


            <h2><b>3.	Overcome Anxiety, Depression, Loneliness, and Fear</b></h2>

            <p>
                During adolescence, many pupils experience mental changes. Isolation and stress can be exacerbated by the school and peer pressure. As a result, kids experience sadness and suicide ideation. Teachers in schools must understand their pupils and assist them in dealing with stress and strain during difficult times. This might be due to financial problems, low self-esteem, excessive social media use, terrible relationships, or drug use. Teachers must discuss depression and how to cope with it. When students join the professional world, they must be able to deal with severe stress and strain. As a result, these concepts must be taught beginning in elementary school.
            </p>
            <h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
            <p>
                Students are valuable in our world. Their destiny is determined by the values they acquire and where they learn them. As a result, all educational institutions must focus on providing each student with a high-quality education and skills.
