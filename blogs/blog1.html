                Drones have become very popular among kids and teens in the past few years. Drones are aircraft that fly
                either autonomously or can be controlled manually with a remote or joystick. You often have seen kids
                playing around the house and parks with this gadget. In recent years, drone sales increased
                significantly from 2.5 million in 2016 to 7 million in 2002. It is available in tones of different
                shapes and sizes in the market. Many new variants and versions are hitting the global market every
                month.
            </p>

            <p>
                The most recent one is the nano drone. Nano drones are a result of the advancement in
                Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and nanotechnology. Nano drones are mini flying quadcopters. It is
                a compact gadget which is loaded with advanced technology.
                You may see nano drones as a play toy for kids but, it is more than that. With the advancement in
                technology, it’s becoming a major military tool due to its miniature size and easy functionality. Here
                are some pros of using Nano Drones:

            </p>
            <h2><b>Miniature size</b></h2>
            <p>
                These are extremely lightweight, pocket friendly, and portable. The weight of inbuilt sensors is
                compatible with the modest payloads of the drone. They weigh no more than 0.55 lbs. It is the standard
                weight set by the FAA for every nano drone. FAA needs registration for drones weighing more than 0.55
                lbs. It is so small that it can easily fit in your palm. They can go even to the minutest place where
                you cannot go. It is facile to handle.
            </p>


            <h2><b>Swift speed</b></h2>

            <p>
                With being tiny in size, it’s also faster in speed. Some drones can take flight just by tossing them in
                the air. They can fly at an approximate speed of 18 kmph. Some drones automatically dodge obstacles
                coming in their path with some in-built special sensors.
            </p>
            <h2><b>Easy control</b></h2>
            <p>
                Nano drones fly, either automatically or with controllers. Users can control the device from a
                smartphone via Wi-Fi. The connection enables P2P live streaming directly from the sky. This connection
                can work till 66 feet. With some in-built devices, you can make them fly automatically. Its main purpose
                is to automate tasks rather than controlling them manually.
            </p>

            <h2><b>Easy control</b></h2>


            <p>
                Sensors that can be used in a nano drone:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Gyroscope – even the cheapest drone consists of this. It is used for the navigation of aircraft. It
                controls the rotational movement.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Barometer – this sensor is used to measure air pressure. It is used to determine the altitude of the
                drone. It provides accurate and faster data.
            </p>

            <p>
                3. Accelerometer – it works along with a gyroscope to regulate the changes in its position and movement.
                It controls the linear movement of the drone.
            </p>
            <p>

                4. GPS – this feature is not available in every drone. It compares the actual position of the aircraft
                with the targeted position.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have migrated to a new city recently and everything is completely strange to you. Then, there are
                many smartphone applications available on the Play Store and Apple store which will help you find
                locations
                with free Wi-Fi hotspots near you. For example, Avast WiFi Finder, WiFiMap.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Rangefinder – it determines at what height the drone is from the ground.
            </p>

            <h2><b>Spy features</b></h2>
            <p>
                The primary buyers of nano drones are the military. Due to its tiny dimensions, military use them for
                security purpose to keep an eye on their enemies. They have inbuilt cameras with which the military can
                monitor the activities of the rival.
                Defence Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) has launched project Nano Humming Bird, a spying device
                that looks like a hummingbird.

            </p>
            <p>Hence, nano drones are a result of the advancement of nano/microtechnology. It has worked wonders in the
                military and commercial sectors of society.</p>
