                You've probably seen instances where you and the other person couldn't agree on anything. It doesn't
                matter if that person is your employer, a co-worker, your spouse/partner, your parents, or even one of
                your best friends. You've probably battled about something before, and in the end, one of you needs to
                make a final decision and compromise.
            </p>

            <p>
                When anything opposes two people's ideals, beliefs, interests, or needs, a conflict occurs. A
                disagreement might be little or huge, but it always has an impact on us. Small conflicts can escalate to
                bigger issues, which can shatter you emotionally and intellectually. It is determined by the importance
                of respect for another person, a lack of understanding, the necessity to maintain a solid connection,
                and stubbornness. These can result in shattered transactions, shattered relationships, the loss of
                assets, and the loss of great opportunities. These conflicts may turn out poorly, and you may experience
                sadness and regret for engaging in them. This frequently occurs when there is a lack of communication,
                trust, and, in some circumstances, hatred.

            </p>

            <p>
                But the question is, how can one protect himself from such harm? When you and the other person are
                arguing about something and can't seem to agree on a solution, you need to find a middle ground. Now
                it's time to consider the role of negotiation.
            </p>




            <p>
                When neither you nor the other person can agree on something, you will almost always arrive to a joint
                agreement. Negotiation is a deft and deliberate conversation between two parties that may include some
                give and take. When conducted in a healthy manner, this debate can settle an unsolvable situation by
                resulting in both sides adopting a consensual solution.
            </p>

            <p>
                A side initiates the process by putting their deal forth. The opposing side, on the other hand, either
                accepts the offer or counters with a counter-offer. If both parties agree, great; if not, the process
                will continue until both parties accept a common resolution. Negotiation can be completed in a short
                period of time, but it can also take years if no parties are able to reach an agreement. It's critical
                to understand how well you can negotiate in order to persuade the other side.
                Even after good communication and respectful discussion, parties may not come to a solution. So, if you
                are the one who is in this situation, then this article is for you.

            </p>

            <h2><b>The solution to this problem</b></h2>


            <p>
                When neither you nor the other side can agree on a course of action, you'll need to know some great
                techniques and methods to make your case more successful and persuasive.
            </p>
            <p>
                How well you know the opponent which makes it easy for you to explain your views and aims that are the
                keys to a successful negotiation. When it comes to persuading the other person, you must first learn
                something about them. Gather information on them, including their strengths and shortcomings. Knowing
                anything or having some knowledge about the other person or party makes it easier for you to create good
                negotiations and offers, which are really needed. If you know some part of them you can easily delivery
                your thoughts in the manner they like.
            </p>
            <p>
                When entering into a negotiation, it is preferable to be well-prepared. To gain complete control and
                dominance over the conversation. This procedure will need some work, but it will be worthwhile in the
                end. Learn as much as you can about your opponent. Knowing their past and who you'll be negotiating with
                can greatly improve your chances of winning the transaction. You'll get what you want if you make an
                offer they can't refuse to.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here's an example to help you understand the problem better. My parents never allowed me to go out with
                friends when I was in college. They were concerned that I might engage in unethical behaviour with my
                pals. They urged me to concentrate on my academics and do well on my tests. Back then, I was an average
                student. But I knew that if I didn't study and made them angry, they would never let me out and live my
                life, even if all I did was hang around with my friends in cafes and malls. So, I made an agreement with
                them that if I did well in every exam, they would never stop me. I promised them if they accepted my
                offer. I knew they were sensitive to my academics and their only want was my good score in it, so I
                attempted to fulfill their wish. That year, I worked really hard and studied whole day and night. This
                caused my score to rise with shuttle speed, and I myself was astounded with my scores. As a result, I
                presented it to them, and they never banned me from doing anything after that. They entrusted my life
                and career to me. They understood that Iâ€™m a big girl now.
            </p>
            <p>

                You may use this technique to negotiate with other individuals. It will never prevent you from attaining
                your goals unless you do not put up any effort. People frequently forget about their opponent and take
                things for granted, resulting in their own defeat. Reduce the distance between you and the other person.
                Don't be abrasive, and express yourself clearly. Make an offer linked to the things that they are most
                interested in. All of these can happen only if you know your opponent.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have migrated to a new city recently and everything is completely strange to you. Then, there are
                many smartphone applications available on the Play Store and Apple store which will help you find
                locations
                with free Wi-Fi hotspots near you. For example, Avast WiFi Finder, WiFiMap.
            </p>
            <p>
                In certain critical instances, this suggestion may be ineffective but in most of the cases it will work.
                You may encounter these circumstances frequently in your life, so don't be discouraged if you don't
                receive anything. Maybe this wasn't your lucky day. Experiment with different approaches and tactics to
                make your proposal and persuade the other person. Continue to try and push yourself. It is common to
                only learn from unpleasant situations. So instead of viewing it as a failure, consider it a lesson
                learnt that you will not repeat.
