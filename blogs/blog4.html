                Birthdays have always been exceptional for everybody. It becomes more exciting if you send them a
                present with a message card. Due to covid-19, it has been almost a year, we all have been locked-up in
                our homes. People have been celebrating their birthdays in isolation. To make our loved one’s special
                day remarkable, we can always write something outstanding for them. Regardless of whether your card is
                homemade or store-bought, with the right words you are ready to go. When it comes to signing off a
                birthday card, many people can grab a pen and instantly start writing a heart-melting message. But if
                you are the one who can’t think of writing anything other than a Happy Birthday? Then this article is
                perfect for you.
            </p>

            <p>
                We all went through this stage when we have a blank page in front of us, it’s the scariest thing when
                you don’t know how to start and where to start. Here are some tips on ‘What to write in a Birthday Card’
                :-

            </p>
            <h2><b>Choose the card</b></h2>
            <p>
                The first step, even before the writing begins, is to choose a perfect card for the receiver. Complete
                the decoration with a theme or a simple heart with some balloons and cake drew/pasted on it. If the
                person is fond of flowers draw some. Note- Not to take just a simple white paper if you want to make it
                look attractive. That would look so dull and half-hearted of you.
                If you are done with this step, we are ready to move on to our next step.

            </p>


            <h2><b>Practice in rough</b></h2>

            <p>
                You can always try scribbling out your thoughts on a blank page first before fairing it out, that will
                give you plenty of time to think. Even if you mess up, there will be chances to correct them up. While
                fairing it out use a fast-drying pen, if not used it could end up smudging the card. Use a white pen
                when using a dark-coloured card.
            </p>
            <h2><b>Write your heart out </b></h2>
            <p>
                If you were waiting for the right moment to express your feelings for that person or if you are an
                introvert or if you feel shy to say it on their face then the best thing is to write it down and send
                them. It will save you from that awkward moment as well as you could tell your feelings for them without
                hesitation.
            </p>

            <h2><b>Greeting</b></h2>


            <p>
                Now, comes the writing part. Always start with an informal greeting with the name or nickname of the
                receiver. For example, Dear Sam, Dear Sophie, etc.
                Then start with a short but effective wish. For example, if they hit a milestone, you can start with
                ‘Happy 50th Birthday John’.

            </p>
            <h2><b>Secret to write a perfect birthday message</b></h2>


            <p>
                For writing the main message, here’s the secret, always stay true and genuine to your thoughts. Don’t try to copy someone, if you want to make that day special for your special person. Always appreciate them, show your love and your true feelings for them. Don’t feel the pressure to fill the whole card, some simple line would work wonders, just write your heart out.  
                If you just sent them a birthday card written by you with all your feelings inside, instead of those fancy, expensive presents, they’ll be over the moon.
                 
                

            </p>
            <h2><b> Memories </b></h2>


            <p>
                This is the most important one if you and that person share a memory. It shouldn’t be a huge one just a small one that is memorable for both of you like gossiping with your mom and laughing at others, or maybe the study day when you and your best friend decided to study together but end up watching Netflix, or the day with your dad that you spent in the garage fixing your cycle, or a day in the kitchen with your spouse. If you feel happy thinking about it, there’s a great chance it will bring them joy too.

            </p>
            <h2><b>End </b></h2>


            <p>
                Lastly, you could end the message with a sign-off like Loads of love, sending you my best wishes, love you a lot, big love, and many more with your name under it.

            </p>
            


            <p>
                So, those were the tips. I hope you found them helpful. These points can go with any kind of birthday card whether it’s your wife, husband, mom, dad, sibling, daughter, son, close friend, neighbour or any other relative. Try them out. Don’t forget to pick a magnificent gift as epic as the birthday card.
